# Client JS for track pages

This is a simple client working without any other cookies (sorry for that)

There is a good thing about it, you just need to add this JS at your site, like this
```
<script type='text/javascript' src='adelarTrack.js'></script>
```
Remember to copy the JS file :)

And like Janis Joplin at the end of Mercedes benz, "that's it hahaha"
